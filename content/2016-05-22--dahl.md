Spun up because of a lack of vegan options at a dinner, this has become an enduring favourite at home. Super easy, fairly fast and inexpesive, its an all-round win. Serve with brown rice (for a complete protein) and spinach, and it's even healthy!


**Difficulty:** Easy (Super Easy)

**Time**: About an hour, depending on your split peas

**Ingredients:**

* 2 cups dry, yellow split peas

* 4 cups vegan stock (vegetable, chicken-flavoured or fish-flavoured are good)

* 2 bay leaves

* 1 teaspoon coriander seeds

* 2 teaspoons garlic powder (or 2 cloves finely chopped onion)

* 2-4 tsp turmeric (to taste; I like a lot, but some people don't!)

* 2 tsp cumin seeds

* 2 tsp yellow mustard seeds

* 2 Tbsp olive oil (or an oil of your choosing)

**Method**

1. Combine all ingredients in a pot over moderate heat.

2. Cook until the split peas are soft, and the dahl a desired consistency (remembering that it will firm up as it cools). Stir occasionally, and taste

3. Enjoy!

**Note**: You can use any combination of split peas, lentils etc. I just prefer the colour of the yellow split peas!
